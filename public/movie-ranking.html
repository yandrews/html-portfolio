<h1>The Best Manga According to Yusef</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Manga of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Slam Dunk</h3>
<p>
Every now and then I come across a manga that becomes my 
new favorite #2. The reason why #1 will never be replaced 
is because Slam Dunk wraps three of my favorite interest in 
one, basketball, manga and comedy.
</p>

<h3>D-Frag</h3>
<p>
The characters in this comedy are full of flavor and I can't 
get enough of the goofy character and straight man combo. 
</p>

<h3>Dorohedoro</h3>
<p>
Love the characters and art style. It takes a comedic 
slice of life take on action, gothic, gory action.
